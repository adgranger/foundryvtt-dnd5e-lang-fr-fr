They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.</p>\n<p>The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.</p>\n<table><caption>\n<h4>Celtic Deities</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Deity</td>\n<td>Alignment</td>\n<td>Suggested Domains</td>\n<td>Symbol</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>The Daghdha, god of weather and crops</td>\n<td>CG</td>\n<td>Nature, Trickery</td>\n<td>Bubbling cauldron or shield</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arawn, god of life and death</td>\n<td>NE</td>\n<td>Life, Death</td>\n<td>Black star on gray background</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Belenus, god of sun, light, and warmth</td>\n<td>NG</td>\n<td>Light</td>\n<td>Solar disk and standing stones</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brigantia, goddess of rivers and livestock</td>\n<td>NG</td>\n<td>Life</td>\n<td>Footbridge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Diancecht, god of medicine and healing</td>\n<td>LG</td>\n<td>Life</td>\n<td>Crossed oak and mistletoe branches</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dunatis, god of mountains and peaks</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>Nature</td>\n<td>Red sun-capped mountain peak</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Goibhniu, god of smiths and healing</td>\n<td>NG</td>\n<td>Knowledge, Life</td>\n<td>Giant mallet over sword</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lugh, god of arts, travel, and commerce</td>\n<td>CN</td>\n<td>Knowledge, Life</td>\n<td>Pair of long hands</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Manannan mac Lir, god of oceans and sea creatures</td>\n<td>LN</td>\n<td>Nature, Tempest</td>\n<td>Wave of white water on green</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Math Mathonwy, god of magic</td>\n<td>NE</td>\n<td>Knowledge</td>\n<td>Staff</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Morrigan, goddess of battle</td>\n<td>CE</td>\n<td>War</td>\n<td>Two crossed spears</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nuada, god of war and warriors</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>War</td>\n<td>Silver hand on black background</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oghma, god of speech and writing</td>\n<td>NG</td>\n<td>Knowledge</td>\n<td>Unfurled scroll</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Silvanus, god of nature and forests</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>Nature</td>\n<td>Summer oak tree</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>The Greek Pantheon</h3>\n<p>The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks.

Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris.

It's a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven't been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it's surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.</p>\n<p>The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).</p>\n<table><caption>\n<h4>Norse Deities</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Deity</td>\n<td>Alignment</td>\n<td>Suggested Domains</td>\n<td>Symbol</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Odin, god of knowledge and war</td>\n<td>NG</td>\n<td>Knowledge, War</td>\n<td>Watching blue eye</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aegir, god of the sea and storms</td>\n<td>NE</td>\n<td>Tempest</td>\n<td>Rough ocean waves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balder, god of beauty and poetry</td>\n<td>NG</td>\n<td>Life, Light</td>\n<td>Gem-encrusted silver chalice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Forseti, god of justice and law</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>Light</td>\n<td>Head of a bearded man</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frey, god of fertility and the sun</td>\n<td>NG</td>\n<td>Life, Light</td>\n<td>Ice-blue greatsword</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Freya, goddess of fertility and love</td>\n<td>NG</td>\n<td>Life</td>\n<td>Falcon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frigga, goddess of birth and fertility</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>Life, Light</td>\n<td>Cat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heimdall, god of watchfulness and loyalty</td>\n<td>LG</td>\n<td>Light, War</td>\n<td>Curling musical horn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hel, goddess of the underworld</td>\n<td>NE</td>\n<td>Death</td>\n<td>Womanʼs face, rotting on one side</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hermod, god of luck</td>\n<td>CN</td>\n<td>Trickery</td>\n<td>Winged scroll</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Loki, god of thieves and trickery</td>\n<td>CE</td>\n<td>Trickery</td>\n<td>Flame</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Njord, god of sea and wind</td>\n<td>NG</td>\n<td>Nature, Tempest</td>\n<td>Gold coin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Odur, god of light and the sun</td>\n<td>CG</td>\n<td>Light</td>\n<td>Solar disk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sif, goddess of war</td>\n<td>CG</td>\n<td>War</td>\n<td>Upraised sword</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Skadi, god of earth and mountains</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>Nature</td>\n<td>Mountain peak</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Surtur, god of fire giants and war</td>\n<td>LE</td>\n<td>War</td>\n<td>Flaming sword</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thor, god of storms and thunder</td>\n<td>CG</td>\n<td>Tempest, War</td>\n<td>Hammer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thrym, god of frost giants and cold</td>\n<td>CE</td>\n<td>War</td>\n<td>White double-bladed axe</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tyr, god of courage and strategy</td>\n<td>LN</td>\n<td>Knowledge, War</td>\n<td>Sword</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uller, god of hunting and winter</td>\n<td>CN</td>\n<td>Nature</td>\n<td>Longbow</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

        "The Planes of Existence": {
          "name": "The Planes of Existence",
          "text": "<p>The cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well as myriad alternate dimensions of reality, called the <strong>planes of existence</strong>. It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.</p>\n<p>Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.</p>\n<h2>The Material Plane</h2>\n<p>The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.</p>\n<p>The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.</p>\n<h2>Beyond the Material</h2>\n<p>Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They’re not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.</p>\n<h3>Planar Travel</h3>\n<p>When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.</p>\n<p>Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.</p>\n<p><strong>Spells. </strong>A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. Plane shift and gate can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.PQuEgKyCdovOvhqN]{Etherealness} allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches—such as the Elemental Planes. And the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.TIoadMIsUKD4edXi]{Astral Projection} spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.</p>\n<p><strong>Portals. </strong>A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fogshrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations— circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns—that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).</p>\n<h3>Transitive Planes</h3>\n<p>The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as <em>etherealness</em> and <em>astral projection</em> allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Ethereal Plane </strong>is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.DQzlB5Y3k791W5bH]{See Invisibility} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XzkJpE6XpZfKjODD]{True Seeing} spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Y7uWUO4yqUN0JKl0]{Forcecage} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.o9ZCvuD2B1OTcubb]{Wall of Force}. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Astral Plane</strong> is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.</p>\n<h3>Inner Planes</h3>\n<p>The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four <strong>Elemental Planes</strong>—Air, Earth, Fire, and Water—form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning <strong>Elemental Chaos</strong>.</p>\n<p>At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form—great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.</p>\n<h3>Outer Planes</h3>\n<p>If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.</p>\n<p>When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally “places” at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.</p>\n<p>Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.</p>\n<p>Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day—if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.</p>\n<p>The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.</p>\n<h4>Outer Planes</h4>\n<p>The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the Upper Planes. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the <strong>Upper Planes</strong>. Planes with some element of evil are the <strong>Lower Planes</strong>. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.</p>\n<h4>Demiplanes</h4>\n<p>Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as <em>demiplane</em>, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz]{Plane Shift} spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV]{Gate} spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.</p>"

Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.</p><p>A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.</p><p>Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic} has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use <em>dispel magic</em>.</p><p>In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.</p><p>You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.</p><p>Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.</p><p>Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.</p>"

The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.</p><p>A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. <strong>Mechanical traps </strong>include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. <strong>Magic traps</strong> are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function as traps.</p><h2>Traps in Play</h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.NizgRXLNUqtdlC1s.JournalEntryPage.q8azjjql1Ya5DeR2 inline]</p><h2>Sample Traps</h2><p>The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.</p><h3>Collapsing Roof</h3><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.</p><p>The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.</p><p>Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.</p><p>The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it’s in danger of collapse.</p><p>When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.</p><h3>Falling Net</h3><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.</p><p>The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.</p><p>When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.</p><h3>Fire-Breathing Statue</h3><p><em>Magic trap</em></p><p>This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.</p><p>The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.</p><p>The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.</p><h3>Pits</h3><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>Four basic pit traps are presented here.</p><p><strong>Simple Pit.</strong> A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.</p><p>The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).</p><p><strong>Hidden Pit. </strong>This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.</p><p>A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.</p><p>When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.</p><p>Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]{Arcane Lock} spell or similar magic.</p><p><strong>Locking Pit. </strong>This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.</p><p>A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.</p><p><strong>Spiked Pit.</strong> This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><h3>Poison Darts</h3><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.</p><p>The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.</p><p>The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><h3>Poison Needle</h3><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.</p><p>When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.</p><p>A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.</p><h3>Rolling Sphere</h3><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap’s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.</p><p>With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate’s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.</p><p>Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.</p><p>The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.</p><p>As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.</p><h3>Sphere of Annihilation</h3><p><em>Magic trap</em></p><p>Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.</p><p>A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.2YNqk5zm9jDTvd7q]{Sphere of Annihilation} that can’t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal <em>sphere of annihilation</em>.</p><p>Some versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the <em>sympathy </em>aspect of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.GJ2WYm3SQFR0winH]{Antipathy/Sympathy} spell. A successful @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic} (DC 18) removes this enchantment.</p>"

Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.</p><h3>Cackle Fever</h3><p>This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: “the shrieks.”</p><p>Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until the disease is cured.</p><p>Any event that causes the infected creature great stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.</p><p>Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.</p><p>At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later.</p><h3>Sewer Plague</h3><p>Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.</p><p>When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.</p><p>It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.</p><p>At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.</p><h3>Sight Rot</h3><p>This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.</p><p>A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qcYitWoSMTnKkzM1]{Heal}.</p><p>Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.</p>"

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p><strong>Drow Poison (Injury). </strong>This poison is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way.

The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage.</p><p><strong>Pale Tincture (Ingested). </strong>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can't be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally.</p><p><strong>Purple Worm Poison (Injury). </strong>This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated purple worm. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>Serpent Venom (Injury). </strong>This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated giant poisonous snake. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>Torpor (Ingested).</strong> A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 4d6 hours.

This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.</p><h3>Alignment</h3><p>Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently.

Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Lawful good</strong> (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.</p>\n<p><strong>Neutral good</strong> (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.</p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic good </strong>(CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.</p>\n<p><strong>Lawful neutral </strong>(LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.</p>\n<p><strong>Neutral</strong> (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.</p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic neutral </strong>(CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.</p>\n<p><strong>Lawful evil </strong>(LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Neutral evil </strong>(NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic evil </strong>(CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.</p>\n<h3>Alignment in the Multiverse</h3>\n<p>For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the goodaligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.</p>\n<p>The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god's influence.)</p>\n<p>Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn't tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.</p>\n<p>Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments—they are <strong>unaligned</strong>. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.</p>"

Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.</p>\n<p>Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is <em>what changed</em>? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring?

          "text": "<p>Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.</p><p>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.</p><p><strong>Armor Proficiency. </strong>Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.</p><p><strong>Armor Class (AC).</strong> Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Heavy Armor. </strong>Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</p><p><strong>Stealth. </strong>If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p><p><strong>Shields. </strong>A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.</p><h2>Light Armor</h2><p>Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Padded. </strong>Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.</p><p><strong>Leather. </strong>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.</p><p><strong>Studded Leather. </strong>Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.</p><h2>Medium Armor</h2><p>Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Hide.</strong> This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.</p><p><strong>Chain Shirt. </strong>Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.</p><p><strong>Scale Mail. </strong>This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.</p><p><strong>Breastplate. </strong>This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.</p><p><strong>Half Plate. </strong>Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.</p><h2>Heavy Armor</h2><p>Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.</p><p>Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.</p><p><strong>Ring Mail.</strong> This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armor.</p><p><strong>Chain Mail. </strong>Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.</p><p><strong>Splint. </strong>This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.</p><p><strong>Plate.</strong> Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption><h4>Armor</h4></caption><thead><tr><td>Armor</td><td>Cost</td><td>Armor Class (AC)</td><td>Strength</td><td>Stealth</td><td>Weight</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><em>Light Armor</em></td></tr><tr><td>Padded</td><td>5 gp</td><td>11 + Dex modifier</td><td>—</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>8 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Leather</td><td>10 gp</td><td>11 + Dex modifier</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>10 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Studded leather</td><td>45 gp</td><td>12 + Dex modifier</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>13 lb.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Medium Armor</em></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Hide</td><td>10 gp</td><td>12 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>12 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Chain shirt</td><td>50 gp</td><td>13 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>20 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Scale mail</td><td>50 gp</td><td>14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>—</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>45 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Breastplate</td><td>400 gp</td><td>14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>20 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Half plate</td><td>750 gp</td><td>15 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>—</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>40 lb.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><em>Heavy Armor</em></td></tr><tr><td>Ring mail</td><td>30 gp</td><td>14</td><td>—</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>40 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Chain mail</td><td>75 gp</td><td>16</td><td>Str 13</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>55 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Splint</td><td>200 gp</td><td>17</td><td>Str 15</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>60 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Plate</td><td>1,500 gp</td><td>18</td><td>Str 15</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>65 lb.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><em>Shield</em></td></tr><tr><td>Shield</td><td>10 gp</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>6 lb.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Getting Into and Out of Armor</h2><p>The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.</p><p><strong>Don. </strong>This is the time it takes to put on armor.

Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.</p><p>The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A <strong>melee weapon</strong> is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a <strong>ranged weapon</strong> is used to attack a target at a distance.</p><h2>Weapon Proficiency</h2><p>Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>martial</strong>. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.</p><p>Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.</p><h2>Weapon Properties</h2><p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.</p><p><strong>Ammunition. </strong>You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way</p><p><strong>Finesse. </strong>When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><p><strong>Heavy. </strong>Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</p><p><strong>Light. </strong>A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</p><p><strong>Loading. </strong>Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><p><strong>Range.</strong> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p><p><strong>Reach. </strong>This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.</p><p><strong>Special. </strong>A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).</p><p><strong>Thrown. </strong>If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p><p><strong>Two-Handed. </strong>This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</p><p><strong>Versatile. </strong>This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p><h3>Improvised Weapons</h3><p>Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.</p><p>Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p><p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p><h3>Silvered Weapons</h3><p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.</p><h3>Special Weapons</h3><p>Weapons with special rules are described here.</p><p><strong>Lance. </strong>You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.</p><p><strong>Net. </strong>A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.</p><p>When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption> </caption><thead><tr><td>Name</td><td>Cost</td><td>Damage</td><td>Weight</td><td>Properties</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><em>Simple Melee Weapons</em></td></tr><tr><td>Club</td><td>1 sp</td><td>1d4 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light</td></tr><tr><td>Dagger</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1d4 piercing</td><td>1 lb.</td><td>Finesse, light, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Greatclub</td><td>2 sp</td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>10 lb.</td><td>Two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Handaxe</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d6 slashing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Javelin</td><td>5 sp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Thrown (range 30/120)</td></tr><tr><td>Light hammer</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1d4 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Mace</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d6 bludgeoning</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Quarterstaff</td><td>2 sp</td><td>1d6 bludgeoning</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d8)</td></tr><tr><td>Sickle</td><td>1 gp</td><td>1d4 slashing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light</td></tr><tr><td>Spear</td><td>1 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Thrown (range 20/60), versatile (1d8)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><em>Simple Ranged Weapons</em></td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow, light</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>5 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 80/320), loading, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Dart</td><td>5 cp</td><td>1d4 piercing</td><td>1/4 lb.</td><td>Finesse, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Shortbow</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 80/320), two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Sling</td><td>1 sp</td><td>1d4 bludgeoning</td><td>—</td><td>Ammunition (range 30/120)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><em>Martial Melee Weapons</em></td></tr><tr><td>Battleaxe</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d8 slashing</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td>Flail</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Glaive</td><td>20 gp</td><td>1d10 slashing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Heavy, reach, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Greataxe</td><td>30 gp</td><td>1d12 slashing</td><td>7 lb.</td><td>Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Greatsword</td><td>50 gp</td><td>2d6 slashing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Halberd</td><td>20 gp</td><td>1d10 slashing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Heavy, reach, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Lance</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d12 piercing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Reach, special</td></tr><tr><td>Longsword</td><td>15 gp</td><td>1d8 slashing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td>Maul</td><td>10 gp</td><td>2d6 bludgeoning</td><td>10 lb.</td><td>Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Morningstar</td><td>15 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Pike</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d10 piercing</td><td>18 lb.</td><td>Heavy, reach, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Rapier</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Finesse</td></tr><tr><td>Scimitar</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d6 slashing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Finesse, light</td></tr><tr><td>Shortsword</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Finesse, light</td></tr><tr><td>Trident</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>Thrown (range 20/60), versatile (1d8)</td></tr><tr><td>War pick</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Warhammer</td><td>15 gp</td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td>Whip</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1d4 slashing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Finesse, reach</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><em>Martial Ranged Weapons</em></td></tr><tr><td>Blowgun</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1 piercing</td><td>1 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 25/100), loading</td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow, hand</td><td>75 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 30/120), light, loading</td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow, heavy</td><td>50 gp</td><td>1d10 piercing</td><td>18 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 100/400), heavy, loading, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Longbow</td><td>50 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 150/600), heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Net</td><td>1 gp</td><td>—</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Special, thrown (range 5/15)</td></tr></tbody></table>"

          "name": "Adventuring Gear",
          "text": "<p>This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.</p><p><strong>Acid.</strong> As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.</p><p><strong>Alchemist's Fire. </strong>This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</p><p><strong>Antitoxin. </strong>A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.</p><p><strong>Arcane Focus. </strong>An arcane focus is a special item— an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item— designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.</p><p><strong>Ball Bearings. </strong>As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.</p><p><strong>Block and Tackle. </strong>A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.</p><p><strong>Book. </strong>A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).</p><p><strong>Caltrops. </strong>As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.</p><p><strong>Candle. </strong>For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</p><p><strong>Case, Crossbow Bolt. </strong>This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.</p><p><strong>Case, Map or Scroll. </strong>This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.</p><p><strong>Chain. </strong>A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p><p><strong>Climber's Kit. </strong>A climber's kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber's kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can't fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can't climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.</p><p><strong>Component Pouch. </strong>A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description).</p><p><strong>Crowbar. </strong>Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar's leverage can be applied.</p><p><strong>Druidic Focus. </strong>A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.</p><p><strong>Fishing Tackle. </strong>This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.</p><p><strong>Healer's Kit. </strong>This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p><p><strong>Holy Symbol. </strong>A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.</p><p><strong>Holy Water. </strong>As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.</p><p><strong>Hunting Trap.</strong> When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p><p><strong>Lamp. </strong>A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.</p><p><strong>Lantern, Bullseye. </strong>A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.</p><p><strong>Lantern, Hooded. </strong>A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.</p><p><strong>Lock. </strong>A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.</p><p><strong>Magnifying Glass.</strong> This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.</p><p><strong>Manacles. </strong>These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.</p><p><strong>Mess Kit. </strong>This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.</p><p><strong>Oil. </strong>Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p><p><strong>Poison, Basic.</strong> You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.</p><p><strong>Potion of Healing. </strong>A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.</p><p><strong>Pouch. </strong>A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).</p><p><strong>Quiver.</strong> A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.</p><p><strong>Ram, Portable. </strong>You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.</p><p><strong>Rations. </strong>Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.</p><p><strong>Rope.</strong> Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.</p><p><strong>Scale, Merchant's. </strong>A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.</p><p><strong>Spellbook.</strong> Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.</p><p><strong>Spyglass.</strong> Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.</p><p><strong>Tent. </strong>A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.</p><p><strong>Tinderbox. </strong>This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.</p><p><strong>Torch.</strong> A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption><h4>Adventuring

Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption><h4>Tools</h4></caption><thead><tr><td>Item</td><td>Cost</td><td>Weight</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><em>Artisan's tools</em></td></tr><tr><td>Alchemist's supplies</td><td>50 gp</td><td>8 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Brewer's supplies</td><td>20 gp</td><td>9 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Calligrapher's supplies</td><td>10 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Carpenter's tools</td><td>8 gp</td><td>6 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Cartographer's tools</td><td>15 gp</td><td>6 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Cobbler's tools</td><td>5 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Cook's utensils</td><td>1 gp</td><td>8 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Glassblower's tools</td><td>30 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Jeweler's tools</td><td>25 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Leatherworker's tools</td><td>5 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Mason's tools</td><td>10 gp</td><td>8 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Painter's supplies</td><td>10 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Potter's tools</td><td>10 gp</td><td>3 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Smith's tools</td><td>20 gp</td><td>8 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Tinker's tools</td><td>50 gp</td><td>10 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Weaver's tools</td><td>1 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Woodcarver's tools</td><td>1 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Disguise kit</td><td>25 gp</td><td>3 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Forgery kit</td><td>15 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><em>Gaming set</em></td></tr><tr><td>Dice set</td><td>1 sp</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Playing card set</td><td>5 sp</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Herbalism kit</td><td>5 gp</td><td>3 lb.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><em>Musical instrument</em></td></tr><tr><td>Bagpipes</td><td>30 gp</td><td>6 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Drum</td><td>6 gp</td><td>3 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Dulcimer</td><td>25 gp</td><td>10 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Flute</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Lute</td><td>35 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Lyre</td><td>30 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Horn</td><td>3 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Pan flute</td><td>12 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Shawm</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Viol</td><td>30 gp</td><td>1 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Navigator's tools</td><td>25 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Poisoner's kit</td><td>50 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Thieves' tools</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles (land or water)</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr></tbody><tfoot><tr><td colspan=\"3\">* See the @UUID[.FayGZfFQU5llJ0LQ]{Mounts and Vehicles} section.</td></tr></tfoot></table><p><strong>Artisan's Tools.</strong> These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade.

If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.</p><p>Mounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example).

Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding.

          "text": "<p>When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.</p><h2>Lifestyle Expenses</h2><p>Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.</p><p>At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character’s career.</p><p>Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.</p><table><caption><h4>Lifestyle Expenses</h4></caption><thead><tr><td>Lifestyle</td><td>Price/Day</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wretched</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Squalid</td><td>1 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Poor</td><td>2 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Modest</td><td>1 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Comfortable</td><td>2 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Wealthy</td><td>4 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Aristocratic</td><td>10 gp minimum</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Wretched.</strong> You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.</p><p><strong>Squalid. </strong>You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.</p><p><strong>Poor.</strong> A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.</p><p><strong>Modest. </strong>A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.</p><p><strong>Comfortable. </strong>Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.</p><p><strong>Wealthy.</strong> Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.</p><p><strong>Aristocratic. </strong>You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/skills/trades/woodcutting-logging-axe-stump.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><h4>Self-Sufficiency</h4><p>The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.</p><p>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.</p></article></div><h2>Food, Drink, and Lodging</h2><p>The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night’s lodging.

Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.</p><p>Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.</p><p>Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption><h4>Services</h4></caption><thead><tr><td>Service</td><td>Pay</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><em>Coach cab</em></td></tr><tr><td>Between towns</td><td>3 cp per mile</td></tr><tr><td>Within a city</td><td>1 cp</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><em>Hireling</em></td></tr><tr><td>Skilled</td><td>2 gp per day</td></tr><tr><td>Untrained</td><td>2 sp per day</td></tr><tr><td>Messenger</td><td>2 cp per mile</td></tr><tr><td>Road or gate toll</td><td>1 cp</td></tr><tr><td>Ship’s passage</td><td>1 sp per mile</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.</p><h2>Spellcasting Services</h2><p>People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.</p><p>Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{Cure Wounds} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{Identify}, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.</p>"

          "text": "<p>Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.</p>\n<p>With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.</p>\n<p>As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.</p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higherthan-average ability scores.</p>\n<table border=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Multiclassing Prerequisites</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Class</td>\n<td>Ability Score Minimum</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Barbarian</td>\n<td>Strength 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bard</td>\n<td>Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cleric</td>\n<td>Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Druid</td>\n<td>Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fighter</td>\n<td>Strength 13 or Dexterity 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monk</td>\n<td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Paladin</td>\n<td>Strength 13 and Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ranger</td>\n<td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rogue</td>\n<td>Dexterity 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sorcerer</td>\n<td>Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Warlock</td>\n<td>Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wizard</td>\n<td>Intelligence 13</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Experience Points</h2>\n<p>The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.</p>\n<h2>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h2>\n<p>You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.</p>\n<p>You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.</p>\n<h2>Proficiency Bonus</h2>\n<p>Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.5LoAJLkfIYBAgWTW]{Character Advancement} table, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.</p>\n<h2>Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.</p>\n<table border=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Multiclassing Proficiencies</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Class</td>\n<td>Proficiencies Gained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Barbarian</td>\n<td>Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bard</td>\n<td>Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cleric</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Druid</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fighter</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monk</td>\n<td>Simple weapons, shortswords</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Paladin</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ranger</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class’s skill list</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rogue</td>\n<td>Light armor, one skill from the class’s skill list, thieves’ tools</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sorcerer</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Warlock</td>\n<td>Light armor, simple weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wizard</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Class Features</h2>\n<p>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.</p>\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>If you already have the Channel Divinity (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.YpiLQEKGalROn7iJ]{Cleric} @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Paladin})feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.</p>\n<h3>Extra Attack</h3>\n<p>If you gain the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo]{Extra Attack} class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.q9g1MLXuLZyxjQMg]{Extra Attack} does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.pJADgAxxefgcATWr]{Thirsting Blade} doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.</p>\n<h3>Unarmored Defense</h3>\n<p>If you already have the Unarmored Defense (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.SZbsNbaxFFGwBpNK]{Barbarian} @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.UAvV7N7T4zJhxdfI]{Monk}) feature, you can’t gain it again from another class.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.</p>\n<p><strong>Spells Known and Prepared.</strong> You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.</p>\n<p>Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Slots. </strong>You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.</p>\n<p>If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that higher level.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know—and potentially enhance their effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Pact Magic.</strong> If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.</p>\n<table border=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Lvl.</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it.

The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.</p>\n<p>For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class.

As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.</p>\n<h2>Contests</h2>\n<p>Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal— for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.</p>\n<p>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.</p>\n<p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.</p>\n<h2>Skills</h2>\n<p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)</p>\n<p>For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.</p>\n<p>The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.</p>\n<h3>Strength</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Athletics</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dexterity</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Acrobatics</li>\n<li>Sleight of Hand</li>\n<li>Stealth</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Intelligence</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Arcana</li>\n<li>History</li>\n<li>Investigation</li>\n<li>Nature</li>\n<li>Religion Wisdom</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Wisdom</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Animal Handling</li>\n<li>Insight</li>\n<li>Medicine</li>\n<li>Perception</li>\n<li>Survival</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Charisma</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deception</li>\n<li>Intimidation</li>\n<li>Performance</li>\n<li>Persuasion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.</p>\n<p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.</p>\n<h3>Variant: Skills with Different Abilities</h3>\n<p>Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.</p>\n<h2>Passive Checks</h2>\n<p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.</p>\n<p>Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:</p>\n<p>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</p>\n<p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a <strong>score</strong>.</p>\n<p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.</p>\n<p>The rules on hiding in the @UUID[.xt6tSGvU9e0vtXw6#dexterity]{Dexterity} section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.</p>\n<h2>Working Together</h2>\n<p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.</p>\n<p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.</p>\n<h3>Group Checks</h3>\n<p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.</p>\n<p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.</p>\n<p>Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.</p>"

The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.</p><h2>Speed</h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.NizgRXLNUqtdlC1s.JournalEntryPage.HhqeIiSj8sE1v1qZ inline]</p><p>The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p><h3>Travel Pace</h3><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.NizgRXLNUqtdlC1s.JournalEntryPage.eFAISahBloR2X8MX inline]</p><h3>Difficult Terrain</h3><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.NizgRXLNUqtdlC1s.JournalEntryPage.hFW5BR2yHHwwgurD inline]</p><h2>Special Types of Movement</h2><p>Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking.

The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.</p><p>For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p><p>Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.</p><p>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.</p>"

          "name": "Between Adventures",
          "text": "<p>Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle Expenses</h2>\n<p>Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.</p>\n<h2>Downtime Activities</h2>\n<p>Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.</p>\n<p>Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.</p>\n<h3>Crafting</h3>\n<p>You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.</p>\n<p>For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5- gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.</p>\n<p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.</p>\n<p>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.</p>\n<h3>Practicing a Profession</h3>\n<p>You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.</p>\n<p>If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.</p>\n<p>If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.</p>\n<h3>Recuperating</h3>\n<p>You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.</p>\n<p>After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.</li>\n<li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Researching</h3>\n<p>The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.</p>\n<p>When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.</p>\n<p>For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.</p>\n<h3>Training</h3>\n<p>You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.</p>\n<p>First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.</p>\n<p>The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.</p>"
